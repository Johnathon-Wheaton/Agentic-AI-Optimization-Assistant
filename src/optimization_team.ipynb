    "# Solving Optimization Problems Using AI Agents\n",
    "This notebook uses autogen to configure a team of AI agents who will help translate a business problem into an optimization model, solve it, and return the results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two sequential conversations:\n",
    "1. The user dialogues with a consultant agent whose goal is to extract every relevant detail about the busuiness problem from the user. Business users are often not familiar with optimization modeling and therefore might not know which details are relevant. It's the consultant's job to ask probing questions before formulating the problem.\n",
    "1. The formulation from the consultant is then handed off to a team that consists of a coder, a code critic, a user proxy, and checker. The coder takes the problem description and formulation and translates it into a python script to be ran by the user proxy. The code critic is responsible for reviewing both the problem formulation and the code to verify that the code has accurately captured all details. The coder, code critic, and user proxy will iteratively edit, critique, and run the code until a solution is found. The checker is merely a final agent to end the conversation when a solution is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "User input is only required in the first conversation while the second conversation is expected to be a backend, closed-door discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "Testing has revealed some opportunities to make the agent capabilities both more effective and with more generalized knowledge. The following are some of the challenges that have been observed:\n",
    "- The coder and code critic can get into an infinite loop where the code critic insists on reversing the previous recommendation.\n",
    "- The coder lacks awareness of the full documentation or latest updates to a python library.\n",
    "- The amount of probing questions asked by the consultant can vary even when the initial input prompt is kept the same.\n"

      "1. **Objective Function Missing Storage Costs**: The objective function should also minimize storage costs. You need to include the storage costs in your objective function, which were not part of the initial setup.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Storage Costs Calculation**: You need to define a cost for storing products, if applicable. You should specify this cost and add it into the objective function as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Handling Inventory Accumulation**: The logic in constraints must ensure that excess production doesn’t cause negative storage. Adding constraints for storage limits would ensure this.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Time Limit and Optimality Gap**: You commented out the solving method with time limit and optimality gap. These parameters should be activated, often included in the solver call.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output Layout**: Ensure your sheet separates the decision variables for clarity. You might want to format the excel output further for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explicit Modifications Needed:\n",
      "- Extend the objective function to include the storage costs.\n",
      "- Clearly define storage costs in the input parameter section.\n",
      "- Ensure that your constraints logically prevent negative inventory.\n",
